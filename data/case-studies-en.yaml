   Agreeble started to answer the question, which opinions drive consensus between
   people on polar ends of an issue?
   <br/>
   We proved the concept by playing an index card version of the game, which worked
   great for about five people. Once we worked out kinks in the model, development
   began, and we started working with larger sample sets. 
   <br/>
   We incorporated in January of 2014 and have since added advisors in research, ux, 
   marketing, and rhetoric. We have additionally partnered with Amazon and uSamp for
   sourcing samples.

   The impact it has varies from user to user. Some use it to impact their brand 
   messaging, others use it to respond to public relations issues. Our political 
   users have leveraged it to study their demographics on local issues.
  impact_longer_term: >
   We believe that part of the problem with polarization is the platform. Our goal 
   is to shed light on the grey, when issues seem black or white, and see if we 
   can't unlock consensus in the process.

   I Paid A Bribe is an online platform that uses citizen reporting 
   to identify corrupt government services and work with local government to 
   effect process change.

   I Paid a Bribe was launched by the co-founders and board members of 
   Janaagraha, a non-profit that works to improve the quality of citizenship, 
   infrastructure and services in India's cities. The site was officially
    launched on August 15, 2010, India's Independence Day.
   <br/>
   The site allows Citizens to report bribes, which Janaagraha uses to push 
   for improving governance systems and procedures, with the goal of 
   tightening law enforcement and regulation, and thereby reducing the scope 
   of corruption in government services. On the site, users can report on the 
   nature, number, pattern, types, location, frequency and values of actual 
   corrupt acts in government.
   <br/>
   Users can sort and view all reports, as well as report "honest officials".
   On average, the site receives about 25 to 50 reports a day. In addition, 
   there are about 20-50 reports and comments a day logged in on the various 
   forums and the administrator’s blog.

    The use of crowd-reporting services has, to date, traditionally been 
    utilized in areas of public works, like reporting potholes. I Paid A Bribe 
    is notable for taking this type of functionality out of the utilitarian 
    realm and applying it to combat corruption. To date, the I Paid A Bribe 
    site has received over 4.5 million visits.
  impact_today: >
    I Paid a Bribe has launched, or is coming soon, to 16 other countries, and 
    may serve as inspiration for other corruption-based crowd reporting 
    initiatives. As of 2012, there were more than 400,000 reports to the site.

    TBD

  challenges: >
    The greatest challenge to the efficacy of I Paid A Bribe is that the 
    initiative is not integrated with government in any official capacity. 
    The platform could also benefit from an improved user-interface, including 
    search functions and access to raw data.

   While the Community section features a map and list of deployments,
   a more central means of discovery for users could prove beneficial.
