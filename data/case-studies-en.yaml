   We proved the concept by playing an index card version of the game, which worked
   great for about five people. Once we worked out kinks in the model, development
   began, and we started working with larger sample sets.

   We incorporated in January of 2014 and have since added advisors in research, ux,

   By accepting submissions at every stage, including the idea stage, the 
   Solutions for Stronger Communities competition lowered the barrier for engagement
   for those with potential solutions who lacked the capital or expertise to put 
   their solutions into action. However, this low barrier to entry could also delay 
   the impact of contest winners, since entries could take a significant amount of

   task that did not make use her financial skills. She was inspired to create a 
   service that would allow professionals to donate their time in a way that 
   was both most useful for the “receiving” organization, and also career-enhancing 
   for the volunteer. In 2014, Catchafire became a key partner in LinkedIn’s

   In his September 2009 Strategy for American Innovation, President Obama called 
   on agencies to increase their ability to promote innovation by using tools 
   such as prizes and challenges to solve tough problems. On March 2010, the 
   Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued a memorandum on the use of 
   challenges/contests and prizes to improve government and encourage innovation, 
   including a promise to make a web-based platform for prizes and challenges 
   within 120 days.
   <br/>
   The OMB memo also promised that the administration would '…make available 
   a web-based platform for prizes and challenges within 120 days'. OMB

   The Consumer Complaint Database launched on June 2013, following the 
   formation of the CFPB in July 2011, which continues to oversee site 
   management. The CFPB was founded as a result of the Dodd–Frank Wall 
   Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which passed in response 
   to the Late-2000s recession and financial crisis. The bureau began 
   operation on July 21, 2011. Congress established the CFPB to protect 
   consumers by carrying out federal consumer financial laws. The CFPB 
   seeks to ensure that consumers get the information they need to make 
   the financial decisions they believe are best for themselves and their 
   families, that prices are clear up front, that risks are visible and 
   that nothing is buried in fine print. The agency has the power to write 
   rules, supervise companies, and enforce federal consumer financial 
   protection laws; restrict unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices; 
   take consumer complaints; promote financial education; research consumer 
   behavior; monitor financial markets for new risks to consumers; and 
   enforce laws that outlaw discrimination and other unfair treatment in 
   consumer finance.

   In the summer of 2012, the CFPB asked for public comment on adding 
   complaints about other consumer financial products and services under 
   its authority to the Consumer Complaint Database and received a wide

   Janaagraha, a non-profit that works to improve the quality of citizenship, 
   infrastructure and services in India's cities. The site was officially
    launched on August 15, 2010, India's Independence Day.
   <br/>
   The site allows Citizens to report bribes, which Janaagraha uses to push 
   for improving governance systems and procedures, with the goal of 
   tightening law enforcement and regulation, and thereby reducing the scope 
   of corruption in government services. On the site, users can report on the 
   nature, number, pattern, types, location, frequency and values of actual 
   corrupt acts in government.
   <br/>
   Users can sort and view all reports, as well as report "honest officials".
   On average, the site receives about 25 to 50 reports a day. In addition, 
   there are about 20-50 reports and comments a day logged in on the various 
   forums and the administrator’s blog.

   PulsePoint is designed to support public safety agencies working to improve 
   cardiac arrest survival rates through improved bystander performance and 
   active citizenship. Where adopted, PulsePoint Respond empowers everyday 
   citizens to provide life‐saving assistance to victims of sudden cardiac 
   arrest. Application users who have indicated they are trained in cardiopulmonary
   resuscitation (CPR) and willing to assist in case of an emergency can now be 
   notified if someone nearby is having a cardiac emergency and may require CPR. 
   If the cardiac emergency is in a public place, the location-aware application 
   will alert trained citizens in the vicinity of the need for bystander CPR 
   simultaneous with the dispatch of advanced medical care. The application also 
   directs these citizen rescuers to the exact location of the closest publicly 
   accessible Automated External Defibrillator (AED).

   The Pulse Point mobile application was first launched by the PulsePoint 
   Foundation in April 2010. The original idea for PulsePoint came from Richard 
   Price, former chief of San Ramon Valley Fire Department, in order to connect 
   those who are trained in CPR with those who are in need of emergency cardiac 
   assistance.
   <br/>
   The first edition of the App “did not contain the location-aware CPR/AED 
   notification capability” and was available exclusively through Apple’s App 
   Store within iTunes. Subsequent versions have location awareness features and 
   are available to Android users in addition to Apple users. San Jose, 
   California became the first community to utilize the app in 2012.
   <br/>
   The Pulse Point app is connected with a middle tier website and a dispatch 
   interface, which allows 911 dispatchers to input cardiac emergency information 
   (including location) into the app. The app uses GPS to notify registered users 
   within walking distance (usually about 0.5 miles away, depending on population 
   density) of both the location of the cardiac emergency and also the location 
   of nearby publicly accessible Automated External Defibrillator (AED).

   Ushahidi is a free, open source interactive mapping platform that can draw in a
   wide variety of data streams to visually present location-based information.
   It was originally developed in response to post-election violence in Kenya in 
   2008 and has since been used for a wide variety of humanitarian and civic ends.

   Ushahidi, which means “testimony” in Swahili, was originally developed by an 
   ad hoc group of volunteers in 2008 to help map reports of violence following 
   the Kenyan election.

   The Ushahidi website provides a wealth of information for developers,
   but little guidance for people seeking to contribute to a particular deployment. 
   While the Community section features a map and list of deployments,
   a more central means of discovery for users could prove beneficial.
