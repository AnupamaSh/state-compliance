   By accepting submissions at every stage, including the idea stage, the 
   Solutions for Stronger Communities competition lowered the barrier for engagement
   for those with potential solutions who lacked the capital or expertise to put 
   their solutions into action. However, this low barrier to entry could also delay

   challenges/contests and prizes to improve government and encourage innovation, 
   including a promise to make a web-based platform for prizes and challenges 
   within 120 days.

   The Consumer Complaint Database launched on June 2013, following the 
   formation of the CFPB in July 2011, which continues to oversee site 
   management. The CFPB was founded as a result of the Dodd–Frank Wall 
   Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which passed in response 
   to the Late-2000s recession and financial crisis. The bureau began 
   operation on July 21, 2011. Congress established the CFPB to protect 
   consumers by carrying out federal consumer financial laws. The CFPB 
   seeks to ensure that consumers get the information they need to make 
   the financial decisions they believe are best for themselves and their 
   families, that prices are clear up front, that risks are visible and 
   that nothing is buried in fine print. The agency has the power to write 
   rules, supervise companies, and enforce federal consumer financial 
   protection laws; restrict unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices; 
   take consumer complaints; promote financial education; research consumer 
   behavior; monitor financial markets for new risks to consumers; and 
   enforce laws that outlaw discrimination and other unfair treatment in 
   consumer finance.

   Drive BC offers nothing in the way of metrics regarding the use and impact 
   of the site. However, the citizen reporting option’s placement on a central 
   Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure web page makes it likely that 
   citizen input will continue to increase and inform government operations. 
   The Twitter account’s 17,600 followers demonstrate its reach and scope.
  impact_longer_term:

   Drive BC’s citizen reporting functionality does not feature any on-site 
   means of citizen input. For all issues, citizens are directed to contact 
   information, notably telephone numbers, with no option for simply typing 
   in a description of the issue and the address directly from the Web or 
   mobile. While this capability exists using the DriveBC Twitter account, 
   it is questionable whether citizens would ascertain this fact from visiting 
   the desktop or mobile Drivebc.ca site.
   <br/>
   Drive BC’s ability to guide citizen input regarding issues on different 
   types of provincial roads and highways, as well as wildfires, chemical 
   spills and downed power lines could go unnoticed by citizens because the 
   link to report such issues is subtly presented on the site. Moreover, 
   the link citizens need to click, on mobile or desktop, is confusingly 
   labeled “Report a Highway Problem.” Based on this subtlety and misleading 
   label, citizens attempting to report a wildfire or a pothole on a municipal 
   road could easily assume that Drive BC is not the correct place to make 
   such a report.

- title: Foldit
  url: http://fold.it/portal/
  description: > 
   Foldit is a online-based puzzle game, where participants engage in simulated 
   protein folding in order to predict protein structure.
   <br/>
   Predicting the lowest energy state of a protein is a task computers are poor at, 
   but people are good at. Foldit is an attempt to gamify the process of predicting 
   protein structures to crowdsource the data-gathering.
   <br/>
   Foldit is the creation of biochemist, David Baker, and game designer, Zoran 
   Popovic, both of whom work at the University of Washington in Seattle. The game 
   is downloaded onto a player’s personal computer and then allow the player to 
   manipulate protein structures.
   <br/>
   There are a series of levels a player moves through, with the earliest levels 
   acting as training rounds, where players work on already-known proteins in 
   order to learn the basics of protein folding skills. The game involves a 
   point-system, where the highest number of points are awarded to those with proteins
   that have been manipulated to have the lowest-energy configurations.
   <br/>
   As described in an article by the Scientific American website, “The Foldit 
   exploration puzzle game attempts to predict the structure of a protein by 
   taking advantage of our puzzle-solving intuitions and having people play 
   competitively to fold the best proteins. Players can also design brand new 
   proteins that could help prevent or treat important diseases.”

   citizenship and infrastructure and services in India’s cities. Janaagraha 
   runs two on-line platforms, ICHangeMyCity.com and IPaidABribe.com. 
   IPaidABribe.com is a platform provided to citizens to crowd source bribe 
   experiences. It is a citizen driven mechanism for tracking bribe payment 
   activity, also instances of when people resisted bribe payments or did 
   not have to pay bribes because of good government systems or good people 
   within the government systems. Citizens’ reports on the nature, number, 
   pattern, types, locations and frequency of actual corrupt acts and values 
   of bribes will add up to a valuable knowledge bank that will contribute 
   to a reduction in bribe payments.
   <br/>
   By providing a place for citizens to report, as well as by analyzing the 
   information, ipaidabribe.com aims to
   * Heighten citizen awareness about the nature and spread of bribe-related 
   exchanges and promote a purposive public debate that pressurises public 
   officials to reduce and eventually eliminate corruption.
   * Help citizens to recognize, avoid and tackle bribe paying situations.
   * Identify and analyse the workflows within corruption prone public services, 
   to make suggestions on systemic reform directed at entrenching simpler and 
   more transparent processes, more consistent standards of law enforcement 
   and better vigilance and regulation.

   The ipaidabribe.com idea has emerged and evolved over time. It commenced 
   with a discussion between co-founders of Janaagraha, Swati and Ramesh 
   Ramanathan and Mr. Sridar Iyengar, a board member of Janaagraha’s advisory 
   board a couple of years back regarding the pernicious effect of corruption 
   on destroying city life and disempowering citizens. The original idea was 
   that the website could become a simple means of tracking the market price 
   of corruption - a kind of market price prediction mechanism. A small 
   experimental website was put up to test the idea. However the afterthought 
   was that such an effort was indeed a very powerful one. Over time, we worked 
   on the idea extensively and added a lot more features. We decided that the 
   website has to be a multifaceted site, providing a variety of services to 
   people. We launched the new completely redesigned website on Aug 15, 2010, 
   India’s Independence day. 
   <br/>
   IPaidABribe.com (IPAB) is an initiative to tackle corruption by tapping 
   into the collective energy of citizens, almost every one of whom is either 
   a victim, perpetrator or beneficiary, or a combination of these. Janaagraha 
   has a very rigorous system of aligning its institutional objectives with 
   the performance of its programmes. Each institutional objective is further 
   aligned with several strategic themes. Ipab aligns with Janaagraha’s goal 
   of making a measurable difference in the quality of Citizenship in cities. 
   It does this by adopting the strategy of empowering citizens using a 
   net-plus- roots approach – we use a net based platform for recording the 
   grassroots experiences of citizens. Through this approach, ipaidabribe.com 
   aligns completely with Janaagraha’s key thrust of increasing the number of 
   citizen change agents in the city. We believe that every citizen who reports 
   a story on our website about paying a bribe, is angry enough to begin to 
   resist it. Of course, it goes without saying that somebody who has resisted 
   paying a bribe and reported the story, is already very much on the path of 
   being a citizen change agent.

   more transparent processes, more consistent standards of law enforcement 
   and better vigilance and regulation.
   Summarising the above, the three fold impact strategy of the platform 
   covers three broad strands 
   a) Education. Through How To's and information, make citizens aware 
   of the government procedures so that bribes are not paid through ignorance. 
   b) Policy Reform. Use of data collected and trend analysis to plug the avenues 
   of corruption.
   c) Redressal. Escalate individual reports to the authorities and department 
   heads who can initiate enquiries/ legal proceedings against the accused.

   A legal impact can be seen only if legal complaints increase and prosecutions 
   happen. Right now, we are engaging in creating a groundswell against corruption, 
   both working with the government to reduce red tape as also with citizens to 
   build up their courage and helping them to overcome corruption. We believe that 
   corruption has grown this big only because as citizens, we have tolerated it. 
   If we actively oppose it and there are enough of us, the government has to 
   buckle down and tackle the problem effectively. To do that, it is also important 
   that we build bridges with and support the actions of honest officials within the 
   government, who often look the other way, because they are dispirited and become 
   cynical.

   The Transport Commissioner in Bangalore called to communicate his embarrassment 
   at finding his department having the highest instances of bribe taking in 
   Bangalore. We worked with him and his senior management team to re-engineer the 
   process flow and reduce the loopholes for rent seeking in the issuance of drivers’ 
   licenses, so that 2 key steps that in the past had a fair amount of subjective 
   discretion in them, were converted to automated tests. 
   <br/>
   As another example, the department for land registration used to have designated 
   offices where one had to go to register the purchase and sale of land – depending 
   on where in the city the particular land parcel was, one had to go to a specific 
   Sub Registrar’s Office. With the ipaidabribe.com data, it was evident that there 
   was a flourishing market for bribes in land transactions, reflecting admirably 
   the laws of supply and demand! Those Sub Registrar offices that were on the periphery 
   of the city, where much of the new growth occurs, were seeing thegreatest rates of 
   bribes, whereas those Sub Registrar Offices which were in the heart of the city, 
   where land transactions are less frequent, were seeing fewer touts and lower rates. 
   So we made a proposal to the Department of Stamps and Registration – given that 
   all land transactions had been converted to electronic records, why not make them 
   ‘Anywhere Registration’? That is, one could go to any Sub Registrar office in the 
   city to register one’s land transaction.

   Our intent is to change the system that breeds corruption, rather than indict the 
   individuals within the system. Besides, even if you change the individuals, the 
   threat of corruption still remains. But change the system and you root out 
   corruption permanently. 
   <br/>
   The role that non-government bodies play is multi-fold since corruption is such 
   a vast and hydra-headed monster - from procurement processes in public projects, 
   to extraction of precious natural resources, to public services, and favouritism/ 
   nepotism towards private enterprise – these are all rife with corruption as 
   instruments for wealth and/or power.

   Currently with our net presence alone, we do realize that we only touch people 
   who have access to the net. With the pace of internet penetration in India, 
   this number is likely to grow rapidly.

   Mobile phone usage in the country is on a surge, we have hence also developed 
   a mobile app to enable people to report their stories via their smart phone. 
   For those who do not have a smart phone, reports can be shared through a bribe 
   hotline, via a call.
   <br/>
   With over 34000 reports on the website, many reports are received from citizens 
   in the major cities (especially the IT hubs of Bangalore, Hyderabad and Chennai). 
   Followed by tier 2 cities in states.

   While we do get a lot of page views ( consuming the content on the platform) 
   reporting of instances of bribe transactions is still in its nascent stages.

   The biggest challenge for IPaidaBribe.com is to respond to the demands of the 
   public, to provide support and information quickly. As this is a web based 
   initiative, it is important that we respond to people very fast. For this purpose, 
   one needs to collect data from the government, analyse government procedures 
   and present the findings in a simple manner. At any given time, we are undertaking 
   research on at least two to three important government procedures or departments.

   PulsePoint is designed to support public safety agencies working to improve 
   cardiac arrest survival rates through improved bystander performance and 
   active citizenship. Where adopted, PulsePoint Respond empowers everyday 
   citizens to provide life‐saving assistance to victims of sudden cardiac 
   arrest. Application users who have indicated they are trained in cardiopulmonary
   resuscitation (CPR) and willing to assist in case of an emergency can now be 
   notified if someone nearby is having a cardiac emergency and may require CPR. 
   If the cardiac emergency is in a public place, the location-aware application 
   will alert trained citizens in the vicinity of the need for bystander CPR 
   simultaneous with the dispatch of advanced medical care. The application also 
   directs these citizen rescuers to the exact location of the closest publicly 
   accessible Automated External Defibrillator (AED).

   The Pulse Point mobile application was first launched by the PulsePoint 
   Foundation in April 2010. The original idea for PulsePoint came from Richard 
   Price, former chief of San Ramon Valley Fire Department, in order to connect 
   those who are trained in CPR with those who are in need of emergency cardiac 
   assistance.
   <br/>
   The first edition of the App “did not contain the location-aware CPR/AED 
   notification capability” and was available exclusively through Apple’s App 
   Store within iTunes. Subsequent versions have location awareness features and 
   are available to Android users in addition to Apple users. San Jose, 
   California became the first community to utilize the app in 2012.
   <br/>
   The Pulse Point app is connected with a middle tier website and a dispatch 
   interface, which allows 911 dispatchers to input cardiac emergency information 
   (including location) into the app. The app uses GPS to notify registered users 
   within walking distance (usually about 0.5 miles away, depending on population 
   density) of both the location of the cardiac emergency and also the location 
   of nearby publicly accessible Automated External Defibrillator (AED).
