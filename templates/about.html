                    <p>States have long had the authority to regulate institutions offering education within the state’s boundaries, regardless of the modality (face-to-face, distance) being used. The approval process is part of consumer protection for learners in the state.  States’ regulations vary from having no regulation to having very strict requirements. Even if an institution teaches only at a distance in a state, institutions are still expected to comply with prescribed regulations. The NYU State Authorization Advisor removes many of the burdens and hurdles from the path of seeking compliance by: </p>
                    <ul>
                    	<li>Removing the need to have lawyers or policy experts read through long and complex legal regulatory documents</li>
						<li>Streamlining the process of creating an accurate budget projection, state-by-state, to achieve compliance</li>
						<li>Simplifying compliance work into simple question and answer prompts, the enable the creation of a comprehensive strategic plan to comply</li>

					<h2 class="uppercase">What is State Authorization</h2>
					<p>State Authorization refers to the regulation of both (1) distance education courses and programs offered to residents of a particular state by an institution based in another state, and (2) various non-distance activities within a particular state by institutions outside of that state.</p>

					<p>Distance education is defined as a system and a process that connects learners with providers via distributed learning resources. While distance learning takes a wide variety of forms, all distance learning is characterized by: a separation of place and/or time between instructor and learner, among learners, and/or between learners and learning resources. Educational activity in the following areas may trigger a need for compliance: non-classroom experiences, marketing and/or advertising, or proctoring. For each of the categories, depending on the nature or level of activity, specific states might consider an activity to formally be a “physical presence” within its borders by an out-of-state institution, whether or not it is related to a  distance education program, and this will necessitate state authorization. Each state has created its own set of standards and guidelines for out-of-state institutions with respect to educational activities within that state’s borders.</p>

                	<h2 class="uppercase">Possible Consequences of Non-Compliance</h2>
                    <p>There have been some public actions taken by regulators against institutions that are non-compliant, often in the form of substantial fines and negative press. Regulators have taken actions against institutions, including subjecting them to substantial fines and, in some cases, negotiating very substantial settlements. Public legal actions have resulted in significant negative media attention on some institutions, and confidential settlements encourage public investigation. The following are documented consequences for non-compliance: </p>
                    <ul>
                    	<li>Receipt of cease and desist orders from state agencies</li>
						<li>Penalty fees from state agencies and more stringent controls once authorization is obtained</li>
						<li>Failure to meet regional accreditation requirements </li>
						<li>Damage to the institution’s reputation through negative publicity </li>
						<li>Lawsuits, often requiring complicated settlements for non-compliant action that negatively impacts enrolled students </li>
						<li>If the U.S. Department of Education reinstates Federal Regulation Chapter 34, §600.9(c), it is anticipated that institutions found not to be in compliance will be asked to reimburse federal financial aid funds for students in the non-compliant states. USED still requires institutions to notify students on where the institution is authorized and on where a student can file a complaint </li>

					<h2 class="uppercase">About the NYU State Authorization Advisor</h2>
					<p>NYU’s State Authorization Advisor is an online tool that provides institutions with the opportunity to concretely understand what, if any, action is required to comply based on their activity, as well as how much it will cost them. The system is comprised of a series of diagnostic questions tied directly to state agency policies and fees. Through probing institutions to enter their institutional characteristics and activity in each state, the system is able to generate a concrete action plan for next steps. This solution attempts to make accessible, through a user-friendly interface, the task of navigating complex regulations, especially for individuals who are not attorneys or policy experts.</p>

					<p>The NYU State Authorization Advisor can answer questions like, "Do I need to authorize?" "Do I qualify for exemption?" "How much will state authorization cost?", "Should I join SARA?". "What will my financial savings be if I do join SARA?".  The end report includes instructions and links that can navigate the user through simple steps that need to be taken to secure compliance in each state and provides access to applicable websites and forms. The NYU State Authorization Advisor can help institutions increase awareness of compliance regulations, understand how the regulations impact institution specific education activity, mitigate risks associated with non-compliance, and gain clarity and direction for a strategic plan and accurate budget projections to comply with state authorization requirements. The NYU State Authorization Advisor is in its second BETA phase and this interactive expo session will provide participants with the opportunity to learn more about this new approach to a solution that enables efficient policy organization and management through innovation.</p>

					<h2 class="uppercase">About Our Database</h2>
					<p>NYU’s State Authorization Advisor includes information from all 81 state authorization regulatory agencies in the US. The database that the questions and advice is generated from accounts for not only simple yes and no responses related to what activity at trigger a compliance requirement, but it also captures the multifaceted nuances that often accompany every trigger.</p>

					<p>In some cases, the regulators require the institutions reach out directly to share specifics of information and a determination of required action is at the discretion of the respective board or commission. In these cases, the advisor is unable to provide clear guidance, but will direct you to the specific person to contact to empower users to easily gain access to the information. </p>

					<p>Primum igitur aequum est, Athenienses, me ad prima quae in me iacta sunt mendacia et primis accusatoribus respondere; deinde ad posteriora et posterioribus. Mihi enim apud vos multi exstiterunt accusatores, qui iam pridem multos per annos et nihil veri dixerunt; quos ego magis metuo quam Anytum eiusque socios, quamvis etiam hi sint graves; verum illi sunt graviores, qui vestrum plerosque a pueritia occupaverint rem persuadentes, quam crimini mihi darent, falsissimam: esse quendam Socratem, virum sapientem, qui et caelestia curet, et quae sub terra sint omnia perquisierit causamque inferiorem efficiat superiorem. hi quod eam famam sparserunt, Athenienses.</p>
