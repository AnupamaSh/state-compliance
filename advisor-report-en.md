You indicated that you want the crowd to perform a specific task: 

- This method implies distributing tasks to a community who are more typically self-selected. 
-  Tasks typically fall into two categories. Microtasks, which are simple, independent tasks that are part of a larger project and cannot be easily automated; and skilled tasks, multi-hour tasks hosted on professional marketplaces.
- Quality control remains a key challenge for this kind of activity.  
- One potential complication of crowdsourcing tasks is navigating intellectual property - make sure to think about who retains the property rights of any final output.

You indicated that you want to collect data from the crowd:

- This activity involves collecting information from a large amount of on-the-ground observers who are more likely to provide a clear picture of an event.
- Data gathering is particularly successful when needing to fill communications gaps during rapidly developing events.
- Data is mostly gathered through mechanisms such as SMS text messaging, social media or via website. Establishing multiple mechanisms to report is usually a key condition to success. 
- Although literature suggests it has tremendous potential, the volume of information can present challenges of data mining, verification and prioritizing.

You indicated that you want to obtain funds from the crowd:

- The mechanism used to obtain fund from the crowd, also known as crowdfunding, usually involves an open call for the provision of relatively small contributions from a relatively large number of individuals.
- One of its advantages is that the mechanism directly connects funders with projects in need of funding, avoiding the traditional slow, multi-step funding processes like grant applications or bank loans.
- A generally key component for the success of this activity occurs when the crowd feels personally connected to the growth of the initiative, that is, when the motivations of both parties are aligned.

You indicated that you want to analyze opinions from the crowd: 

- They key component of this activity is that it has the capacity to leverage the real-time web browsing, and increased overall connectivity around the globe of ordinary citizens.  
- Also named, sentiment analysis, companies have generally used it as a method of automatic detection of negative and positive emotions, opinions and other evaluations in text. 
- A challenge of crowdsourcing opinions is that it is complicated to build software that mines the Internet for opinions and has the ability to interpret that data.
Another challenge is the fact that sometimes multiple sentiments are directed at the same or different targets in a single sample.

You indicated that you want the crowd to find innovative solutions:

- Generally, it’s important to have a technology platform that allows you to both ask the right question and filter through the submissions to obtain the answers you’re looking for.
- The public sector often uses “ideation platforms” to crowdsource ideas. These online platforms provide space for brainstorming and voting to enable the crowd to submit new ideas, search previously submitted ideas, post questions and challenges, discuss and expand on ideas, vote ideas up or down and flag ideas that don’t fit the question. 
- Given the relatively new stages of ideation platforms, institutions and entrepreneurs must acknowledge that, given certain technological constraints, the results they wish to achieve may not be the most sound. 
- One potential complication of crowdsourcing ideas is navigating intellectual property - make sure to think about who retains the property rights of any final output.
