These online platforms provide space for brainstorming and voting to enable the crowd to submit new ideas, search previously submitted ideas, post questions and challenges, discuss and expand on ideas, vote ideas up or down and flag ideas that don’t fit the question.</li>
								<li>Given the relatively new stages of ideation platforms, institutions and entrepreneurs must acknowledge that, given certain technological constraints, the results they wish to achieve may not be the most sound.</li>
								<li>One potential complication of crowdsourcing ideas is navigating intellectual property - make sure to think about who retains the property rights of any final output.</li>

                            	<li>Financial incentives are typically provided through a contest dynamic as a prize or in exchange for labor on a specific activity.</li>
                            	<li>Financial incentives are particularly effective when crowdsourcing tasks. However, the amount offered for the task can matter. Paying a larger amount for a specific number of tasks as opposed to paying a small amount per task increases the quality of the output.</li>
								<li>Some studies have shown financial rewards can have a negative effect on creative results. Therefore, whether to include a financial reward should be an important consideration for tasks that are intended to be more creative.</li>
