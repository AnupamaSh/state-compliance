Right now, we are engaging in creating a groundswell against corruption,  both working with the government to reduce red tape as also with citizens to  build up their courage and helping them to overcome corruption. We believe that  corruption has grown this big only because as citizens, we have tolerated it.  If we actively oppose it and there are enough of us, the government has to  buckle down and tackle the problem effectively.

We worked with him and his senior management team to re-engineer the  process flow and reduce the loopholes for rent seeking in the issuance of drivers’  licenses, so that 2 key steps that in the past had a fair amount of subjective  discretion in them, were converted to automated tests.  <br/> As another example, the department for land registration used to have designated  offices where one had to go to register the purchase and sale of land – depending  on where in the city the particular land parcel was, one had to go to a specific  Sub Registrar’s Office. With the ipaidabribe.com data, it was evident that there  was a flourishing market for bribes in land transactions, reflecting admirably  the laws of supply and demand! Those Sub Registrar offices that were on the periphery  of the city, where much of the new growth occurs, were seeing thegreatest rates of  bribes, whereas those Sub Registrar Offices which were in the heart of the city,  where land transactions are less frequent, were seeing fewer touts and lower rates.  So we made a proposal to the Department of Stamps and Registration – given that  all land transactions had been converted to electronic records, why not make them  ‘Anywhere Registration’? That is, one could go to any Sub Registrar office in the  city to register one’s land transaction.

",Tools,"The ipaidabribe.com idea has emerged and evolved over time. It commenced  with a discussion between co-founders of Janaagraha, Swati and Ramesh  Ramanathan and Mr. Sridar Iyengar, a board member of Janaagraha’s advisory  board a couple of years back regarding the pernicious effect of corruption  on destroying city life and disempowering citizens. The original idea was  that the website could become a simple means of tracking the market price  of corruption - a kind of market price prediction mechanism. A small  experimental website was put up to test the idea. However the afterthought  was that such an effort was indeed a very powerful one. Over time, we worked  on the idea extensively and added a lot more features. We decided that the  website has to be a multifaceted site, providing a variety of services to  people. We launched the new completely redesigned website on Aug 15, 2010,  India’s Independence day.  <br/> IPaidABribe.com (IPAB) is an initiative to tackle corruption by tapping  into the collective energy of citizens, almost every one of whom is either  a victim, perpetrator or beneficiary, or a combination of these. Janaagraha  has a very rigorous system of aligning its institutional objectives with  the performance of its programmes. Each institutional objective is further  aligned with several strategic themes. Ipab aligns with Janaagraha’s goal  of making a measurable difference in the quality of Citizenship in cities.  It does this by adopting the strategy of empowering citizens using a  net-plus- roots approach – we use a net based platform for recording the  grassroots experiences of citizens. Through this approach, ipaidabribe.com  aligns completely with Janaagraha’s key thrust of increasing the number of  citizen change agents in the city. We believe that every citizen who reports  a story on our website about paying a bribe, is angry enough to begin to  resist it. Of course, it goes without saying that somebody who has resisted  paying a bribe and reported the story, is already very much on the path of  being a citizen change agent.
