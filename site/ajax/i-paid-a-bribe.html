	    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">I Paid a Bribe was launched by the co-founders and board members of  Janaagraha, a non-profit that works to improve the quality of citizenship,  infrastructure and services in India's cities. The site was officially
 launched on August 15, 2010, India's Independence Day.
<br/> The site allows Citizens to report bribes, which Janaagraha uses to push  for improving governance systems and procedures, with the goal of  tightening law enforcement and regulation, and thereby reducing the scope  of corruption in government services. On the site, users can report on the  nature, number, pattern, types, location, frequency and values of actual  corrupt acts in government. <br/> Users can sort and view all reports, as well as report "honest officials". On average, the site receives about 25 to 50 reports a day. In addition,  there are about 20-50 reports and comments a day logged in on the various  forums and the administratorâ€™s blog.
