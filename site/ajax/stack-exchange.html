		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">Stack Exchange is an information exchange platform founded by Jeff Atwood and  Joel Spolsky. Users can ask questions on a given topic, and receive crowd-vetted  answers. <br/>  Stack Exchange is a network of expert Q&A communities, each categorized by a  specific professionalized field. As of July 2014, there are 125 Q&A sites within  the Stack Exchange Network, with subjects as varied as programming to cooking.  On each discrete topic site, any user can ask a question, to which the community  submits answers. The community ranks the answers that are the best fit for the  question, so the answer with the most votes becomes the most visible, and the  least applicable answer is voted down. The questions and answers can also be  amended by the community, wiki-style. <br/> The Stack Exchange community is self-governed. Governance is based on site  reputation. Reputation is earned by other community members voting on that users  previous activity. A user gains more rights as their reputation builds. Rights  include deleting, editing, and running for moderator, an elected individual who  has increased access to managing a Q&A site.
