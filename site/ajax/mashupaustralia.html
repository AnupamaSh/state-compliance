		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">The Australian Government 2.0 Taskforce created Mashup Australia to offer a  practical demonstration of the benefits that open access to Australian public  sector information (PSI) can provide. By working to establish this contest,  the government also provided a practical demonstration of what open access is  and does, while identifying some of the barriers that exist within government  to a broader adoption of open access to PSI.

		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">In 2009, from October – November, the Australian government released 59  government datasets from 23 local and national agencies for a “hackathon.” <br/> The Government 2.0 Taskforce was established by the Australian Government  in 2009 as a joint initiative between the Hon. Lindsay Tanner MP, Minister  for Finance and Deregulation and Senator the Hon. Joe Ludwig, Cabinet  Secretary and Special Minister of State. <br/> The purpose of the Taskforce is to investigate how the Australian Government  can increase the openness of government and encourage greater online  engagement.

		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-title"><span>Challenges</span></div>
		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">The greatest impediment to the program is that Australia lacks a central  hub for all challenges, but instead has one-off sites and programs. This  compounds other problems, most notably those regarding resource allocation;  for example, individual agencies are not empowered to launch their own  challenges, and most challenges tend to be short-lived.
