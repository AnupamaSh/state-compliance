		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">99designs is an online platform that connects graphic designers  with potential clients by hosting design challenges. <br/> The company creates their products by crowdsourcing, as customers can  solicit designers to submit designs for contests to create products  such as websites, t-shirts, or logos. The customer then chooses the best  design from the pool of submitted entries and the selected designer will  win a cash payment. Customers also have the option of working with individual  designers by purchasing design templates from 99designsâ€™ Readymade logo store  or by visiting Swiftly for quick graphic design fixes and steal logo's.
