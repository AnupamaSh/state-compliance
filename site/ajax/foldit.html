		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">Foldit is a online-based puzzle game, where participants engage in simulated  protein folding in order to predict protein structure. <br/> Predicting the lowest energy state of a protein is a task computers are poor at,  but people are good at. Foldit is an attempt to gamify the process of predicting  protein structures to crowdsource the data-gathering. <br/> Foldit is the creation of biochemist, David Baker, and game designer, Zoran  Popovic, both of whom work at the University of Washington in Seattle. The game  is downloaded onto a player’s personal computer and then allow the player to  manipulate protein structures. <br/> There are a series of levels a player moves through, with the earliest levels  acting as training rounds, where players work on already-known proteins in  order to learn the basics of protein folding skills. The game involves a  point-system, where the highest number of points are awarded to those with proteins that have been manipulated to have the lowest-energy configurations. <br/> As described in an article by the Scientific American website, “The Foldit  exploration puzzle game attempts to predict the structure of a protein by  taking advantage of our puzzle-solving intuitions and having people play  competitively to fold the best proteins. Players can also design brand new  proteins that could help prevent or treat important diseases.”
