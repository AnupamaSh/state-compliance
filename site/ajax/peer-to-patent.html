		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">The Peer-to-Patent project captured the importance of getting expertise and  information into government to inform policymaking. Peer To Patent is the first social-software project directly linked to decision-making by the federal government.  It is only one approach in the potential evolution toward more open and  collaborative institutions. <br/> Peer To Patent is a historic initiative by the United States Patent and Trademark  Office (USPTO) that opens the patent examination process to public participation for  the first time. Peer to Patent is an online system that aims to improve the quality of  issued patents by enabling the public to supply the USPTO with information relevant to  assessing the claims of pending patent applications. <br/> An initial pilot examined more than 220 patent applications in the fields of software  and business methods. The Peer To Patent project has issued two anniversary reports  from the initial pilot and a final report from the initial pilot is pending. <br/> Other patent offices involved in pilot programs include IP Australia,the Japan Patent  Office, and the Korean Intellectual Property Office.The UK Intellectual Property Office  announced on November 4, 2010, that it would commence a pilot in 2011 and the pilot  commenced on 1 June 2011.

		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">In 2005, before Facebook and Twitter, New York Law School students and the chair of the Research Network, Beth Noveck, designed and later launched Peer to Patent,  the first expert network in government, which connected volunteer scientists  and technologists to national patent offices to better inform how they decide  who gets the twenty year grant of the monopoly right called a patent. They  invented the process, technology and the policy by which a closed bureaucracy could  open its doors and collaborate with knowledgeable people to do its work better. Time  after time, the public was able to dig up quickly the expertise the official could not find, enabling him/her to make the final determination informed by citizen  participation but subject to the independent law and rules of the patent process.  Despite the fact that patent practice had not changed much since Thomas Jefferson  began as the first examiner in 1791, under the new Patent Act, passed with near  unanimity – Peer to Patent citizen engagement, once an experimental pilot undertaken  only with the applying inventor's consent – is now enshrined in law.

		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">Criticism of the Peer to Patent project range from its goals to its likelihood of success.  Other criticisms focus on the legal constraints and the implications for third party  participants in the approval process.
