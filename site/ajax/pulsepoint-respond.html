		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">PulsePoint is designed to support public safety agencies working to improve  cardiac arrest survival rates through improved bystander performance and  active citizenship. Where adopted, PulsePoint Respond empowers everyday  citizens to provide life‐saving assistance to victims of sudden cardiac  arrest. Application users who have indicated they are trained in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and willing to assist in case of an emergency can now be  notified if someone nearby is having a cardiac emergency and may require CPR.  If the cardiac emergency is in a public place, the location-aware application  will alert trained citizens in the vicinity of the need for bystander CPR  simultaneous with the dispatch of advanced medical care. The application also  directs these citizen rescuers to the exact location of the closest publicly  accessible Automated External Defibrillator (AED).

		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-title"><span>Historical Information</span></div>
		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">The Pulse Point mobile application was first launched by the PulsePoint  Foundation in April 2010. The original idea for PulsePoint came from Richard  Price, former chief of San Ramon Valley Fire Department, in order to connect  those who are trained in CPR with those who are in need of emergency cardiac  assistance. <br/> The first edition of the App “did not contain the location-aware CPR/AED  notification capability” and was available exclusively through Apple’s App  Store within iTunes. Subsequent versions have location awareness features and  are available to Android users in addition to Apple users. San Jose,  California became the first community to utilize the app in 2012. <br/> The Pulse Point app is connected with a middle tier website and a dispatch  interface, which allows 911 dispatchers to input cardiac emergency information  (including location) into the app. The app uses GPS to notify registered users  within walking distance (usually about 0.5 miles away, depending on population  density) of both the location of the cardiac emergency and also the location  of nearby publicly accessible Automated External Defibrillator (AED).
