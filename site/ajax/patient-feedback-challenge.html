		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">The United Kingdom’s National Health Service (NHS) Institute for Innovation and  Improvement created the Patient Feedback Challenge to generate and implement  ideas to improve patient experiences at NHS organizations. Ideas were published  on a web channel, and nine were chosen by an expert panel. Programs were piloted  at nine participating NHS organizations and funded from August 2012 to March  2013, when the NHS Institute was disbanded. The projects were selected following  their bid for a share of the £1 million Challenge fund which was set aside to  support the most promising approaches to measuring and improving patient  experience.
