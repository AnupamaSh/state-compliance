		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">SeeClickFix is a multifaceted citizen reporting engine featuring user-generated  information in a wide variety of areas. The site’s Web 2.0-like interface provides  a wealth of information on a given issue, and allows for users to interact with  existing problems on the site, potentially amplifying their importance for  governments. <br/> SeeClickFix is a growing platform that allows citizens to publicly report a wide  variety of civic issues and then monitor their development. The most active cities  on the platform are Chicago, Illinois; Washington, DC; Malden, Massachusetts; Macon,  Georgia and Winston-Salem, North Carolina. <br/>  The SeeClickFix website prompts users to enter their neighborhood into a form,  which leads them to a site featuring a searchable collection of user-generated  issues that allow for citizen comments, featuring an issue “up-voting” system.  The collection of issues can be viewed in list form, on a map or as a gallery of  uploaded images. Each individual issue entry can feature user-supplied images,  the ability to view the issue on a map, information on when it was reported and  by whom, a list of notified stakeholders, the ability for users to follow the  issue and links to other nearby problems reported on the site. Each neighborhood  also features an “Answers” user forum, a list of “Neighbors” using the site and a  collection of mapped “Watch Areas” for user monitoring. <br/> SeeClickFix also offers mobile apps for IOS, Android, Windows Phone and Blackberry that allow citizens to report issues, browse open problems, view a list of active neighbors and send and receive messages. The company also provides links on its  website for governments to request custom mobile apps for their area.

		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-title"><span>Challenges</span></div>
		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">A lack of advanced browsing and search filters for a given neighborhood could  make it difficult for users to find information on a given issue, particularly  if they are not aware of the exact geographic location of the issue. While the  option exists for users to simply create a second entry on the issue, spreading  the comments and up-votes on the issue across two or more entries could dilute  influence.
